#  Decentralized Event Ticketing Platform (Smart Contract Architecture)

This repository contains the **smart contract architecture** for a decentralized event ticketing platform.  
It uses a **Factory + Proxy (Upgradeable)** pattern to deploy and manage on-chain events with built-in **sponsorship funding**, **ticketing**, and **automated payroll disbursement** for workers.

---

##  Smart Contract Overview

### **Core Concept**
Each event deployed is its own **upgradeable proxy contract** with isolated state and logic.  
Sponsors, event owners, and workers interact transparently with the event instance, and all balances remain publicly viewable on-chain.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Summary

| Contract | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| **EventFactory** | Deploys new event contracts using the upgradeable proxy pattern |
| **EventProxy** | Proxy contract that delegates calls to the event implementation |
| **EventImplementation** | Core logic for event funding, ticketing, sponsorship, and revenue distribution |
| **SponsorVault** | Handles sponsor deposits and calculates proportional revenue share |
| **Payroll** | Manages and disburses worker payments automatically post-event |
| **Ticketing** | Handles ticket minting, purchase, and refunds (ERC721/ERC1155 compatible) |

## üß© Smart Contract Flow

1. **EventFactory**
   - Creates new event instances using proxies.
   - Maps each event owner to their deployed contract.
   - Calls the `initialize()` function on each new proxy after deployment.

2. **EventImplementation**
   - Handles main logic: sponsor deposits, funding goals, ticket sales, and revenue tracking.
   - Prevents further sponsor deposits once the funding goal is met.
   - Integrates with `SponsorVault` for deposits and payouts.
   - Triggers payroll disbursement and sponsor distribution when the event ends.

3. **SponsorVault**
   - Maintains internal accounting for sponsor contributions.
   - Calculates each sponsor‚Äôs percentage of total deposits.
   - Distributes event revenue proportionally after event completion.

4. **Payroll**
   - Event owners can register workers and their payment amounts.
   - Disburses payments automatically after event completion.
   - Uses pull or automated payment model for safety.

5. **Ticketing**
   - Mints event tickets (ERC721 or ERC1155 standard).
   - Manages ticket sales, transfers, and revenue tracking.
   - Revenue automatically links to event balance for post-event distribution.

## üß≠ Upgradeable Architecture

This project uses **OpenZeppelin‚Äôs upgradeable contracts**.

- **Proxy Type:** UUPS or TransparentUpgradeableProxy  
- **Base Contracts:** `Initializable`, `OwnableUpgradeable`, `UUPSUpgradeable`
- **Storage Management:** Maintain a consistent variable order across upgrades.
- **Upgrade Flow:**
  1. Deploy new implementation contract.
  2. Call `upgradeTo()` through the proxy admin.
  3. Initialize any new state variables in an upgrade-safe initializer.
